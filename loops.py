#loop is acondition that allows us to repeat tasks based of a condition
#we have two primitive loops 1. while loops 2. for loops
#it #allows us to excecute aset of statements as long as condition is tru
#EXAMPLE

start = 1
# while start < 8:
#     print(start)
#     start += 1


while start < 8:
    print(start)
if start == 3:
      break
    start += 1

# start = 0
# while start < 8 :
#     print(start)
# if start == 3 :
